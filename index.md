# Welcome to my Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 
I have a strong foundation in computer science, with experience gained through numerous coding classes, database management, and IT courses since middle school. My main programming experience includes building a website using HTML and CSS, completing beginner projects in C, and regularly using the command line and Linux terminal for learning and experimentation. I am skilled at leveraging the internet to learn and implement new technologies and programming languages, with a basic understanding of how programming integrates into various systems. Additionally, I have hands-on experience building several computers from individual components and am highly proficient in AI and prompt engineering, enabling me to optimize and adapt cutting-edge technologies effectively. Outside of my technical pursuits, I am a cheerleader at UCF and actively participate in community engagement initiatives, further demonstrating my strong communication and teamwork skills.
