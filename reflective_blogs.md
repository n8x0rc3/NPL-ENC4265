## Analysis of YouTube's 2005 Website

### 1. First Impressions  
The 2005 YouTube homepage feels super basic compared to today. The layout has simple tabs like "Home," "Favorites," and "Videos" at the top, and the login section is front and center. The design is plain, functional, and completely reliant on Adobe Flash Player, which is outdated now. It‚Äôs clear there wasn‚Äôt much focus on visuals or user experience.

### 2. What Stood Out  
- **Flash Dependency**: The ‚ÄúFlash Player is no longer supported‚Äù error really shows its age. Modern sites use HTML5 instead.  
- **No Thumbnails**: There are no images or video previews‚Äîsomething we now take for granted.  
- **Static Design**: The layout doesn‚Äôt adapt to different screen sizes, which would feel unusable on a phone or tablet today.  

### 3. Modern Standards vs. Then  
Today‚Äôs websites are polished, responsive, and filled with dynamic content. I open YouTube and expect personalized video recommendations, seamless playback, and an easy-to-navigate layout. This old version feels clunky and sterile compared to the YouTube I know now. Its so streamlined that unless I had something specific in mind I can just open YouTube and have hours of content I like displayed to me without having to search for something. 

### 4. Overall Experience  
Looking at the site now is shocking because it seems like the websites back then were super functional. It was home, menu, and whatever the site provided. I enjoy the modern touch and seamless design of modern day websites, but the old school websites really do have a fun retro feel. They remind me of hacker tutorial websites, or cyberpages where the information can be insane but its delivered in a functional feel.
