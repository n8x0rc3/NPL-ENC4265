# Wayback Analysis

## Analysis of YouTube's 2005 Website

### 1. First Impressions  
The 2005 YouTube homepage feels super basic compared to today. The layout has simple tabs like "Home," "Favorites," and "Videos" at the top, and the login section is front and center. The design is plain, functional, and completely reliant on Adobe Flash Player, which is outdated now. It‚Äôs clear there wasn‚Äôt much focus on visuals or user experience.

### 2. What Stood Out  
- **Flash Dependency**: The ‚ÄúFlash Player is no longer supported‚Äù error really shows its age. Modern sites use HTML5 instead.  
- **No Thumbnails**: There are no images or video previews‚Äîsomething we now take for granted.  
- **Static Design**: The layout doesn‚Äôt adapt to different screen sizes, which would feel unusable on a phone or tablet today.  

### 3. Modern Standards vs. Then  
Today‚Äôs websites are polished, responsive, and filled with dynamic content. I open YouTube and expect personalized video recommendations, seamless playback, and an easy-to-navigate layout. This old version feels clunky and sterile compared to the YouTube I know now. It's so streamlined that unless I had something specific in mind, I can just open YouTube and have hours of content I like displayed to me without having to search for something.  

### 4. Overall Experience  
Looking at the site now is shocking because it seems like the websites back then were super functional. It was home, menu, and whatever the site provided. I enjoy the modern touch and seamless design of modern-day websites, but the old-school websites really do have a fun retro feel. They remind me of hacker tutorial websites or cyberpages where the information can be insane but is delivered in a functional feel.

## Prompt
A: Reflect on your assigned reading this week in a detailed manner that demonstrates you read and understood the assigned reading. What can you 'take away' from this reading? What insightful concepts did you read about that can inform your own technical communication activities? 

## Response

This week‚Äôs reading emphasized structuring digital content for usability. A key takeaway was shifting from a *document mindset* to an *information mindset*‚Äîusers seek quick answers, not dense manuals. The reading compared effective web content to **index cards**, where each section provides concise, relevant details instead of overwhelming users with large blocks of text.  

A major insight was **thoughtful content division**, ensuring information is organized by user needs, whether by **questions, tasks, product types, audience, or sequential steps**. The reading also highlighted the importance of **concise web pages**, balancing content length for readability, mobile-friendliness, and printability.  

Another critical point was **using PDFs sparingly**‚Äîthey are often inaccessible, difficult to navigate, and not mobile-friendly. Web-based formats with clear pathways improve user experience.  

### Application to Technical Communication  

For IT and cybersecurity documentation, these principles improve clarity and accessibility. I will:  

- **Structure content for quick navigation** (e.g., FAQs, step-by-step guides).  
- **Use clear headings and pathways** for better readability.  
- **Minimize reliance on PDFs** in favor of accessible web content.  
- **Focus on concise, user-centered writing**.  

This reading reinforced that **effective technical communication isn‚Äôt just about delivering information‚Äîit‚Äôs about ensuring users can easily find and use it.**

## Prompt Used: 

"I wrote this reflection on this week‚Äôs reading, but I want to make sure it follows the 'shorter is better' model of technical writing. Please review it for clarity, remove unnecessary filler, and revise it to be more concise while still retaining key takeaways. If anything is unclear, adjust it for better readability."

## Prompt Revisions

The initial response was too detailed for the 'shorter is better' model, so I revised it to be more concise, removing redundancy while ensuring key takeaways remained clear and actionable.

## Prompt

Prompt C: Ask a generative AI tool (maybe one in Boodlebox or Copilot) to generate something you might have to write in your future career. Assess the result, and then revise your prompt or "stack" an additional prompt onto it (e.g., "remove the passive voice and add headings"). Congratulations, you're a prompt engineer now. Add this skill to your resume. On your website, post: 1) your original and revised prompts 2) your assessment of what it generated 3) (optional) what it generated

## Response

Original Prompt:
"Generate a professional email educating employees about phishing attacks. The email should be clear, concise, and include examples of common phishing attempts, warning signs, and best practices for avoiding them."

Revised Prompt:
"Generate a professional yet engaging phishing awareness email for employees. Use a friendly and clear tone. Include bullet points for key takeaways, a short real-world example of a phishing email, and a direct call to action (e.g., 'Report suspicious emails to IT'). Avoid passive voice and ensure it remains concise."

Assessment:
The first version was informative but too formal and not engaging enough. After refining the prompt, the output was clearer, more actionable, and better suited for a company-wide email.
