## Analysis of YouTube's 2005 Website

### 1. First Impressions  
The 2005 YouTube homepage feels super basic compared to today. The layout has simple tabs like "Home," "Favorites," and "Videos" at the top, and the login section is front and center. The design is plain, functional, and completely reliant on Adobe Flash Player, which is outdated now. It’s clear there wasn’t much focus on visuals or user experience.

### 2. What Stood Out  
- **Flash Dependency**: The “Flash Player is no longer supported” error really shows its age. Modern sites use HTML5 instead.  
- **No Thumbnails**: There are no images or video previews—something we now take for granted.  
- **Static Design**: The layout doesn’t adapt to different screen sizes, which would feel unusable on a phone or tablet today.  

### 3. Modern Standards vs. Then  
Today’s websites are polished, responsive, and filled with dynamic content. I open YouTube and expect personalized video recommendations, seamless playback, and an easy-to-navigate layout. This old version feels clunky and sterile compared to the YouTube I know now. Its so streamlined that unless I had something specific in mind I can just open YouTube and have hours of content I like displayed to me without having to search for something. 

### 4. Overall Experience  
Looking at the site now is shocking because it seems like the websites back then were super functional. It was home, menu, and whatever the site provided. I enjoy the modern touch and seamless design of modern day websites, but the old school websites really do have a fun retro feel. They remind me of hacker tutorial websites, or cyberpages where the information can be insane but its delivered in a functional feel.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
